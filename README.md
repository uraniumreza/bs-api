# bs-api

api services of bs-trading retail application

## Running on local machine

I hope you've `nodejs` and `npm/yarn` installed on your machine. And we'll need `nodemon` installed as globally too, if you don't have `nodemon` no worries; just hit this - `sudo npm i nodemon -g`. Now, just follow me to get bs-api up and running on your machine -

```
git clone git@github.com:uraniumreza/bs-api.git && cd bs-api
yarn
nodemon
```
